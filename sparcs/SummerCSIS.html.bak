            <h1>2015 Summer CSIS Experience</h1>
            The program will be run in Roger Bacon Hall on Siena's campus
            Monday-Friday August 31 - September 4 (moving in on Sunday August
            30).&nbsp; There will be morning and afternoon sessions each day, as
            well as some evening sessions.&nbsp; Some activities will involve a
            computer and some will not.&nbsp; If you will be living on campus
            for the Fall 2015 semester, you can simply move in to your regular
            dorm room a week early.&nbsp; If not, we will put you up in a dorm
            for the week.&nbsp; In either case, there is no cost to you for food
            or lodging.&nbsp; In addition, if you live locally and would rather
            not live in the dorms during the program, that is fine too.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The goal of this program is to help you decide whether Computer
            Science is something you want to explore further (and if you do,
            we'll save a seat for you CSIS110 in the Fall or Spring).&nbsp; You
            are not committed to anything beyond this week, however. &nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            So, what will we do during the week?&nbsp; A combination of hands-on
            activities and guest presentations.&nbsp; We will introduce 1-2
            topics per day, Afternoons will be spent exploring how these topics
            are applied in our labs. Here is a list of potential topics (this
            list may change):<br>
            <br>
            Robotics<br>
            Game Development<br>
            Big Data<br>
            Networks and Graphs<br>
            Models of Computation<br>
            Manipulating images and sounds<br>
            Programming in Java<br>
            Data sharing and transactions<br>
            <br>
            In addition to the primary daily activities of learning about the
            field of Computer Science, we will also (mainly in the evening)
            offer faculty lectures, guest presentations about career
            opportunities, areas of research in computer science, and talks from
            our current advanced CS majors discussing their internships, career
            prospects, how to choose a major/minor, research work, etc.<br>
            <br>
            Computer Science is an exciting field with many career opportunities
            for majors and enhanced career opportunities for minors:&nbsp; “The
            sexiest job of the 21st century is not a social media entrepreneur
            nor Hollywood producer. If you take a cue from the Harvard Business
            Review, the title goes to data scientists. That’s right. Data
            scientist, as in, the type of person who can write computer code…”<br>

            Seven of the top "Best Jobs in America" are in computing.&nbsp; What
            job was at the top? Computer Systems Engineer, making more than the
            average college professor. Software engineering was rated 2012's Top
            Job (http://bit.ly/ZTCPoa) as well as America's Best Job of 2011
            (http://bit.ly/ZTCIZP). But wait, there's more!&nbsp; According to
            the Bureau of Labor Statistics, CS/IT jobs are projected to be one
            of the fastest-growing job areas over the next decade (i.e. in
            addition to being well-paid and fun, there are plenty of them).<br>

            content will be on a separate page&gt;<br>
            <br>
            In the words of some recent Siena alumni:<br>
            <br>
            “Having always had an interest in modern computer technologies, I
            decided to take a gamble and see what the world of Computer Science
            and programming is all about. After taking CSIS 110, and CSIS 120, I
            was hooked. Programming is like being given a box full of tools and
            unlimited material to build whatever you could possibly desire to be
            spilled out onto a computer screen. By the end of CSIS 120 I was
            programming a java based emulator for the classic video game
            "Pac-Man", and that summer the Computer Science professors at Siena
            College were offering me a paying position on a Research Team for
            Artificial Intelligence programming. Finding my niche in the world
            of Computer Sciences has provided me not only with joy for the field
            I intend to make a career out of but also opportunities that I
            likely wouldn't have received anywhere else."<br>

            “This year I have taken both CSIS 110 &amp; CSIS120 and they are
            just great! The class has a logical feel to it compared to other
            non-CSIS classes. It is a nice change of pace, and the coursework is
            enjoyable. I wish I had tried CS classes sooner because I am now
            finishing my senior year at Siena.&nbsp; I have enjoyed the CS so
            much that I am currently looking for ways to continue my computer
            science education after graduation. In my bit of work experience, I
            found background knowledge in your major is assumed - you begin to
            add value when you offer something different. A Computer Science
            minor provides a great start to setting yourself apart.” <br>
